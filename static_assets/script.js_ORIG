"steps":"Preheat your oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C). Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or lightly greasing it.\n\n
In a mixing bowl, cream together softened butter, granulated sugar, and packed brown sugar until light and fluffy.\n\n
Add eggs, one at a time, to the butter-sugar mixture, beating well after each addition.\nMix in vanilla extract until well combined.\n\n
In a separate bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.\n\nGradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients,
mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.\n\n
Fold in semi-sweet chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the cookie dough.\n\n
Using a spoon or cookie scoop, scoop out portions of the cookie dough and roll them into balls about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter.\n
Place the cookie dough balls onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each cookie to allow for spreading.\n
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown.\n\n
Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies cool on the pan for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n
Once cooled, serve and enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!",
